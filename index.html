              <div class="card-body">
                I've always enjoyed a puzzle, and to me that's what coding is.
                During college, I took an Excel class as required part of my
                major where we learned VBA. Since then, I've poked around on
                codeacademy.com.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I started with OpenDNS right after they were acquired by
                Cisco, I was on the recruiting team. I moved over to the
                customer success department to assist with onboarding new
                customers. I learned about DNS and how the internet works. We
                have Hackathons twice a year, and the first one I participated
                in I didn't have a project I was working on. One of the
                engineers taught a Python class. It was so much fun, I just
                wanted to keep learning.
                <br />
                <br />
                The role I'm currently in doesn't offer much in the means of
                coding. It's a project based job, so sometimes I have downtime.
                I was curious one day about taking a bootcamp to learn to code.
                I googled coding bootcamps, and found a course through the
                University of Berkeley's extension program. It sounded perfect.
                <br />
                <br />
                So far, I've gotten the chance to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                and jQuery. I've gotten to practice with many different and
                intersting projects, some featured on my portfolio page.
                Additionally, I got the experience of working in a group to
                build a really fun games app. I'm loving learning to code and
                would love to move into a role that allows for more coding and
                problem solving.
